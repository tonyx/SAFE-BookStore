## Install pre-requisites

You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* The [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or v20.x)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v9.x or v10.x)
* [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Getting started

Before you run the project **for the first time only** you must install dotnet "local tools" with this command:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
```

To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

This will also spin up a local docker container with Azurite storage emulator which is used to save the wishlist data.

The build project in root directory contains a couple of different build targets. You can specify them after `--` (target name is case-insensitive).

Finally, there are `Bundle` and `Azure` targets that you can use to package your app and deploy to Azure, respectively:

```bash
dotnet run -- Bundle
dotnet run -- Azure
```
